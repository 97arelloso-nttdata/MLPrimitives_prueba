Contributing to the Project
===========================

MLPrimitive library is an open source compendium of all possible data transforms that are used by
machine learning practitioners. It is a community driven effort, so it relies on the community.
We designed it thoughtfully so much of the contributions here can have shelf life greater than
any of the machine learning libraries it integrates. It represents the combined knowledge of all
the contributors and allows many systems to be built using the annotations themselves. A few
examples of such systems in healthcare, education will be soon released. You can contribute to
the library in several ways:

Reporting Issues
----------------

If there is something that you would like to see changed in the project, or that you just want
to ask, please create an issue at https://github.com/HDI-Project/MLPrimitives/issues

If you do so, please:

* Explain in detail what you are requesting.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement or respond.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project and that the maintainers will attend every
  request as soon as possible, but that in some cases this might take some time.

Below there are some examples of the types of issues that you might want to create.

Request new primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you will feel that a necessary primitive is missing and should be integrated.

In this case, please create an issue indicating the name of the primitive and a link to
its documentation.

If the primitive documentation is unclear or not precise enough to know what needs to be
integrated only by reading it, please add as many details as necessary in the issue description.

Request new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is any other feature that you would like to see implemented, such as adding new
functionalities to the existing custom primitives, or changing their behavior to cover
a broader range of cases, you can also create an issue.

If you do so, please indicate all the details about what you request as well as some use
cases of the new feature.

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you find something that fails, please report it including:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Ask for Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is something that is not documented well enough, do not hesitate to point at that
in a new issue and request the necessary changes.

Write Documentation
-------------------

MLPrimitives could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official MLPrimitives
docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such, so feel free to
contribute any changes that you deem necessary, from fixing a simple typo, to writing whole
new pages of documentation.

Contribute code
---------------

If you want to contribute to the project with your own code, you are more than welcome
to do so! :)

The necessary steps depending on the type of contributions are thoroughly covered in the next
sections of this documentation. Keep reading!
